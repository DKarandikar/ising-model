# ising-model

Basic Ising model using monte-carlo in python

# Overview and Aims

Basic implementation of a monte-carlo method to the 2d Ising model. Currently the only result is an energy-temperature graph showing the phase shift around 2.5 T. 

Want to implement more graphs, such as heat capactiy and magnetization to see the phase shift from more angles. Also potentially want to run it as an observable simulation to see the phases form.


## Installation

The application requires matplotlib and numpy.

To run on windows, if git is installed:

        git clone https://github.com/DKarandikar/ising-model.git
        cd ising-model
        python Ising.py

Otherwise use the github clone function directly and then just run using python in the download location.


## Example Usage

Run in terminal and type y to run the faster test procedure. Result should be a graph of the form:
